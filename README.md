As someone who is always passionate for learning more about new technologies and experiencing old ones. Saijal grew up developing python, electron, php and js apps and ever since he's a self taught developer. He, like any developer who has burnt the midnight oil, knows how to make a mean cup of coffee ☕️ but he loves having a cup tea more than coffee!
